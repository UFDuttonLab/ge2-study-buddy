    question: "A biological community is best defined as:",
    options: [
      "A group of individuals of the same species living in the same area.",
      "All the biotic and abiotic factors in a given area.",
      "A group of populations of different species living close enough to interact.",
      "The dominant life form that defines a specific spatial area.",
      "The study of the distribution and abundance of a single species."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "A biological community is specifically defined as a group of populations of different species that live close enough together to potentially interact. This definition focuses on the assemblage of different species and their potential for interaction, which is the foundation of community ecology.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "This describes a population, not a community. A population consists of individuals of the same species.",
      "This describes an ecosystem, which includes both living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components.",
      "This describes a biome or habitat type, defined by dominant physical or biological characteristics.",
      "This describes the field of population ecology, which focuses on single species rather than multi-species assemblages."

    question: "Match the species interaction with its corresponding symbolic representation (+ for benefit, - for harm, 0 for no effect). 1. Mutualism 2. Competition 3. Commensalism 4. Predation",
    options: [
      "1: (+/0), 2: (+/+), 3: (-/-), 4: (+/-)",
      "1: (+/+), 2: (-/-), 3: (+/0), 4: (+/-)",
      "1: (+/-), 2: (-/-), 3: (+/+), 4: (+/0)",
      "1: (-/-), 2: (+/0), 3: (+/-), 4: (+/+)",
      "1: (+/+), 2: (+/0), 3: (-/-), 4: (+/-)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The correct symbolic representations are: Mutualism (+/+) - both species benefit; Competition (-/-) - both species are harmed; Commensalism (+/0) - one benefits, other unaffected; Predation (+/-) - predator benefits, prey is harmed. These symbols are fundamental to understanding ecological interactions.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "This incorrectly assigns commensalism as (+/0) to mutualism and mutualism as (+/+) to competition.",
      "This confuses predation (+/-) with mutualism and gets the other relationships wrong.",
      "This reverses several relationships and incorrectly assigns symbols.",
      "This completely misassigns all the interaction types."

    question: "The phenomenon where two species cannot coexist indefinitely on the same limiting resource is known as:",
    options: [
      "Resource Partitioning",
      "The Niche Concept",
      "Competitive Exclusion Principle",
      "Intraspecific Competition",
      "Predator-mediated Coexistence"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "The Competitive Exclusion Principle, formulated by G.F. Gause, states that two species competing for the exact same limiting resource cannot coexist indefinitely - one will eventually outcompete and exclude the other. This principle is fundamental to understanding community structure and species coexistence.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "Resource partitioning is actually a mechanism that allows species to avoid competitive exclusion by using resources differently.",
      "The niche concept describes the role and resource requirements of a species, but not the exclusion principle itself.",
      "Intraspecific competition occurs within species, not between different species.",
      "Predator-mediated coexistence is a mechanism that can prevent competitive exclusion, not the exclusion principle itself."

    question: "Caribbean anole species are able to coexist in the same tree primarily through:",
    options: [
      "Competitive exclusion.",
      "Predator-mediated coexistence.",
      "Occupying different microhabitats, such as different perch heights or sun/shade conditions (resource partitioning).",
      "Having identical fundamental niches.",
      "A commensal relationship with the tree."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Caribbean anoles demonstrate classic resource partitioning by occupying different microhabitats within the same tree. Different species prefer different perch heights, branch thicknesses, and light conditions, allowing them to coexist by reducing direct competition for the same resources.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "Competitive exclusion would prevent coexistence, not enable it.",
      "While predators may play a role, the primary mechanism is habitat partitioning, not predator-mediated coexistence.",
      "Identical fundamental niches would lead to competitive exclusion, not coexistence.",
      "The relationship with the tree is not commensal - the anoles are using the tree as habitat for their own interactions."

    question: "Which of the following scenarios describes **intraspecific competition**?",
    options: [
      "Lions and hyenas fighting over a carcass.",
      "Two oak seedlings growing close together and competing for light and water.",
      "A praying mantis capturing and eating a grasshopper.",
      "Barnacles and mussels competing for space on a rock.",
      "Bees pollinating flowers in exchange for nectar."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Intraspecific competition occurs between individuals of the same species. Two oak seedlings (same species) competing for limited light and water resources is a perfect example of intraspecific competition, where members of the same species compete for the same resources.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "This is interspecific competition between different species (lions vs. hyenas).",
      "This is predation, not competition - one organism consuming another.",
      "This is interspecific competition between different species (barnacles vs. mussels).",
      "This is mutualism, a mutually beneficial interaction, not competition."

    question: "Which term describes the total number of different species in a community?",
    options: [
      "Species evenness",
      "Species diversity",
      "Species richness",
      "Alpha diversity",
      "Gamma diversity"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Species richness specifically refers to the total number of different species present in a community, regardless of their abundance. It's the simplest measure of diversity, focusing only on counting species without considering how evenly distributed they are.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "Species evenness measures how equally abundant the species are, not the total number of species.",
      "Species diversity combines both richness and evenness into a single measure.",
      "Alpha diversity is the mean species diversity within habitats, not just the number of species.",

      "Species evenness",
      "Species diversity",
      "Beta diversity",
      "Trophic structure"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Species evenness describes how evenly distributed individuals are among the different species in a community. High evenness means species have similar abundances, while low evenness means some species dominate numerically.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "Species richness only counts the number of species, not their relative abundances.",
      "Species diversity is a composite measure that includes both richness and evenness.",
      "Beta diversity compares species composition between different sites.",

    question: "An interaction where one species is harmed and the other is unaffected (-/0) is called:",
    options: [
      "Competition",
      "Commensalism",
      "Predation",
      "Mutualism",
      "Amensalism"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    explanation: "Amensalism is a type of interaction where one species is negatively affected while the other species is unaffected. Classic examples include large trees shading smaller plants or antibiotics produced by fungi harming bacteria without the fungi being affected.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "Competition affects both species negatively (-/-).",
      "Commensalism benefits one species while leaving the other unaffected (+/0).",
      "Predation benefits the predator while harming the prey (+/-).",

    question: "The evolutionary divergence in beak size among Galápagos finches on islands where multiple species coexist is an example of natural selection driven by:",
    options: [
      "Mutualism",
      "Predation",
      "Interspecific competition",
      "Commensalism",
      "Random genetic drift"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Character displacement in Galápagos finch beak sizes results from interspecific competition for food resources. When species coexist, natural selection favors individuals with beak sizes that minimize competition by specializing on different food sources, leading to evolutionary divergence.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "Mutualism involves beneficial interactions, not competitive divergence.",
      "Predation would affect survival but wouldn't cause this specific pattern of morphological divergence.",
      "Commensalism doesn't create selective pressure for character displacement.",
      "Random genetic drift wouldn't produce the systematic pattern of divergence observed when species coexist."

    options: [
      "Food",
      "Water",
      "Space",
      "Nutrients",
      "Temperature"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    explanation: "Temperature is an abiotic environmental factor that affects organisms but is not a 'resource' that organisms consume or deplete. Limiting resources are materials or space that organisms use and can become depleted, creating competition.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "Food is consumed by organisms and can be depleted, making it a limiting resource.",
      "Water is consumed and can be limited, especially in arid environments.",
      "Space (territory, nesting sites, etc.) is a finite resource that organisms compete for.",
      "Nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus are consumed and can become limiting factors."

    options: [
      "Many species, with one species being highly dominant.",
      "Few species, but all with equal abundance.",
      "Many species, all with relatively equal abundance.",
      "Few species, with one being extremely rare.",
      "Only one or two species."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "High species diversity requires both high species richness (many species) and high evenness (relatively equal abundances). This combination maximizes the diversity index and indicates a well-balanced community structure.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "This has high richness but low evenness due to dominance, resulting in lower diversity.",
      "This has high evenness but low richness, limiting overall diversity.",
      "This has very low richness and evenness, resulting in very low diversity.",
      "This represents the lowest possible diversity - minimal richness."

      "Protection",
      "Nutrition",
      "Competition",
      "Commensalism"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Mycorrhizal relationships are nutritional mutualisms where both partners exchange essential resources - fungi provide plants with water and nutrients (especially phosphorus) while plants provide fungi with carbohydrates from photosynthesis.",
    wrongAnswerExplanations: [
      "Transport mutualism typically involves seed dispersal or pollination services.",
      "Protection mutualism involves one species defending another from enemies.",
      "This is not competition since both species benefit rather than being harmed.",
      "This is not commensalism because both species benefit, not just one."
